  <h2>Important Quotes</h2>
<p>"Call me Stuart, Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to intrest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the WATERY parts of the world."</p>
<p>"I always go to sea as a SAILOR, because of the WHOLESOME exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck."</p>
